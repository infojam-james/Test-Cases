##Prompting the Critical Incidents Forms

**IF** 

Incident Categorisation has 'Critical Incident' tag (to be created)

**THEN**

Extra confirmation box (words to the effect of 'are you really, *really* sure?') appears when 'Submit' button is clicked.

**IF**

'Yes' is clicked from the extra confirmation box

**THEN**

Severity of Case is changed to 'Critical' (needs creating)


*H&S Admins can also manually change Severity of Case to 'Critical', as they can at present for High/Medium/Low*



**IF**

Severity of Case = Critical

**THEN**

Forms appear


Case Severity can be manually changed *from* Critical, without affecting the Categorisation.
